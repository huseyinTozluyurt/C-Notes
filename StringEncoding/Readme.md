# Simple String Encoding in C++

This program performs custom encoding on two strings using basic arithmetic and ASCII manipulation. It showcases manual string traversal and modification.

## ðŸ“‹ Features

- Calculates string size manually (without `.length()`)
- Encodes:
  - `str1` by adding a fixed key (`+8`) to each character
  - `str2` using a custom `128 % char` transformation
- Prints encoded strings and their lengths

## ðŸ§  Concepts Used

- Range-based `for` loops
- ASCII value manipulation
- Manual string length calculation
- Index-based string printing
