# Player Rating Classifier Using `std::list` in C++

This C++ program uses the Standard Template Library's `std::list` container to categorize player ratings into three groups: **Beginner**, **Pro**, and **Invalid**. It demonstrates list operations, iteration, and conditional classification.

## ðŸ“‹ Features

- Uses `std::list<int>` to store and process player ratings
- Separates ratings into three categories:
  - **Beginner**: ratings less than 4
  - **Pro**: ratings from 4 to 10 (inclusive)
  - **Invalid**: ratings above 10
- Implements custom functions to:
  - Count elements in a list
  - Print list contents in a formatted style

## ðŸ§  Concepts Demonstrated

- `std::list` container
- Iterators (`begin()`, `end()`, `const_iterator`)
- List traversal and modification
- Function modularity
- Reference passing for efficient memory usage
