# Palindrome Checker with Stack and Loop in C++

This program checks whether strings are palindromes using **two methods**:
- `isPalindrome()` → iterative comparison
- `xxx()` → stack-based reverse matching

It validates both implementations across a list of example phrases and prints `"ok"` if results match, or `"error"` if not.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Case-insensitive comparison (`tolower`)
- Stack-based string reversal
- Loop-based symmetrical character comparison
- Vector for batch testing

## 🛠️ Build and Run

```bash
g++ -o palindrome PalindromeCheck.cpp
./palindrome
