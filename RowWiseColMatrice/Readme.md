# Matrix Access Pattern Benchmark in C++

This program demonstrates the performance difference between **row-wise** and **column-wise** memory access in a large 2D matrix. It also prints and transforms smaller matrices for demonstration.

## 📋 Features

- Initializes and prints a `3x5` matrix
- Applies row-wise and column-wise transformations
- Measures and compares access time for a `10000x10000` matrix
- Shows how cache behavior affects access time

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- 2D array traversal and printing
- Row-major vs. column-major access patterns
- Performance measurement using `clock_t`
- Macro constants for matrix dimensions
